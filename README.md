Mathematics & Computer Science Notes from University of Illinois
================
Introduction
-----------
I started making this collection of notes as I was in college. I used these guides in order to study, and they proved to be very useful. I thought it would have been nice to share them, so that everybody can benefit from them. 
I find these notes to be especially good if I have to refresh my knowledge of computer science. Useful before interviews, or if I have to look up something.
Please note that I have not created the material in these notes. All the merit for the good stuff goes to the professors who have taught the classes. Errors or omissions are all my fault.
Discrete Structures - CS 173
----------
I took this class in Spring 2011, the professor was Margaret Fleck. This notes are mainly a collection of formulas and definitions used in the class.
Data Structures - CS 225
---------
I had the pleasure to take this class with Cinda Heeren, an excellent professor. Unfortunately, I did not take good notes while I was taking the class in Spring 2011. I put together these notes as I find very useful to have a good reference of data structures, plus it is an excellent way to get the material back in my mind. A lot of the material here is drawn from lecture notes and Wikipedia.

System Programming - CS 241
---------
This is a study guide I had created for one of the midterms. We were provided with a series of questions, and I managed to answer them all in this study guide. Interesting overview of many operative systems topics.

Theory of Computation - CS 373
---------
I took this class in Spring 2012, with Steve LaValle. This has been so far my favorite class in college. Both the materials and the professor were wonderful. 
I highly recommend reading over the Halting Problem, as the proof is simply genial. One of my favorite pieces of Mathematics ever created. Thank you, Mr. Turing!
Computer Security - CS 461
---------
In the exams of this class, we were allowed to bring a paper with anything written on, front and back. I think the professor underestimated the power of LaTeX, as I was able to fit so much information in just two pages. I think I learned more about latex than the class itself while doing this study guide.

Probability - Math 461
---------
I took this class in Spring 2012, with Peter Loeb. This study guide is a collection of formulas and theorems. It covers elementary concepts in Probability, up to the Central limit theorem.
